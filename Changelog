0.27 DJATOM's mod 2 (2016-8-12)
merged: new options from BM's mod 3 (depth, par, fps). Old 'wheels' removed.
removed: -log option. Guess it useless now.
removed: 'Distributor'-related code. Use Avs+, if you want multi-threaded Avisynth.
new: implemented native HBD support. Only 16-bit and float for now. I'll add more stuff here once it will be merged in Avs+ from PR.
new: -nstdr option. Silences all stderr output. Use it when piping to external encoder. 
improvement: now application prints progress console, so -log is not needed under Wine. The output schema was reworked and should be better.
Also migrated to avisynth_c.h from Avs+, it makes me easy to support new avs+ stuff when it will come. 
GCC will complaints about avisynth_c.h, but I think it's not that critical.
